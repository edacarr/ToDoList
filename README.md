Problem Definition: Creating a Todo List

Objective:
Design a mobile application feature that allows users to create a Todo list. Users should be able to add items to the list by pressing an "Add" button and remove items from the list.

Features:

Add Item: Users can input a new task into a text field and press an "Add" button to add it to the list.
Remove Item: Each item in the list should have an associated delete button or action that allows users to remove that specific item from the list.
Constraints:

The application should be developed for a mobile platform (Android).
User interface elements should be intuitive and easy to use.
The list should be visually appealing and responsive to user interactions.
The application should handle adding and removing items efficiently, even with a large number of items.
Implementation Approach:

User Interface: Design a user interface that includes a text input field for adding new items, an "Add" button, and a list view to display existing items.
Functionality: Implement the logic for adding items to the list when the "Add" button is pressed. Also, implement the logic for removing items from the list when the delete button associated with each item is pressed.
Testing: Perform thorough testing to ensure that the Todo list feature works as expected, including adding and removing items without errors or unexpected behavior.
Feedback and Iteration: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders and make any necessary improvements or adjustments based on their input. Iteratively refine the feature until it meets the desired requirements and user expectations.
Success Criteria:

Users can successfully add new items to the Todo list.
Users can easily remove items from the Todo list when they are no longer needed.
The Todo list feature is intuitive and user-friendly, requiring minimal effort for users to add and remove items.
The feature performs well and remains responsive even with a large number of items in the list.
